#Description
This app was made as part of the university of essex CSEE 2020/2021 team project challenge. This particular app was created by team 26 for this challenge.
The project assigned was to create an app which will visualise data partaining to covid-19. The solution that we found to doing this was to create an app which will display a graph, allowing for easy visualisation and comparison between datasets.
This graph currently only shows the dataset for infection rates. Specifically, it only shows the cumulative number of infectionsevery day since the first infection was recorded.


#Instructions
Run the .jar file, select a country to view data for and select how many weeks you would like to look into the future. If you would like, you can also compare 2 datasets by selecting a second country to compare with.
Press one of the 2 buttons to make the comparison. The apply button will create the graph with the raw data. Allowing you to see the actual figures in the datasets.
The average button will show a reduced version of the graph. This will have been averaged out based on population size and can be used to visualise the proportion of infections in 2 countries.
